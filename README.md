## Overview

Hasami Shogi is a 2-player game with one player moving the red pawns and one player moving the black pawns. Pawns can be captured if they are sandwiched either horizontally or vertically by the opponentâ€™s pawns. Valid move returns True; false, otherwise. A player wins
when the opponent has one or zero pawns left on the board.
